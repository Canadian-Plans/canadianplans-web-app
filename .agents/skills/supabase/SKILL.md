# Supabase

## Canadian Plans boundaries

This local adaptation follows [PLATFORM_CONTEXT.md](../../../PLATFORM_CONTEXT.md).
The backend alone accesses business data; frontend Supabase Auth does not authorize
frontend Data API access. Use the restricted runtime role and transaction-local
`app.workspace_id` RLS, including the documented bootstrap exceptions. Generic
`auth.uid()` examples below illustrate provider behavior, not this project's tenant
policy. Storage is private R2; jobs use the outbox and the long-lived Railway backend's
bounded scheduler, with authenticated manual job routes for recovery. Introducing
Supabase Storage, Edge Functions or a second scheduler is a separate architecture choice.

Schema changes use Drizzle in [packages/db](../../../packages/db/), its existing
generation/migration scripts and committed history. Use isolated local/test data
for experiments; do not mutate a connected remote schema to discover a migration.
Production execution belongs to the owner.

## Core Principles

**1. Supabase changes frequently — verify against changelog and current docs before implementing.**
Do not rely on training data for Supabase features. Function signatures, config.toml settings, and API conventions change between versions.

First, fetch `https://supabase.com/changelog.md` (a lightweight summary index — not a heavy pull), scan for `breaking-change` tags relevant to your task, and follow the linked page for any that apply. Then look up the relevant topic using the documentation access methods below.

**2. Verify your work.**
Verify the changed behavior with the appropriate query, auth-flow test or configuration check. Documentation-only edits need consistency/link checks, not a live database query.

**3. Recover from errors, don't loop.**
If an approach fails after 2-3 attempts, stop and reconsider. Try a different method, check documentation, inspect the error more carefully, and review relevant logs when available. Supabase issues are not always solved by retrying the same command, and the answer is not always in the logs, but logs are often worth checking before proceeding.

**4. Exposing tables to the Data API:** Depending on the user's [Data API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<ref>/integrations/data_api/settings), newly created tables may not be automatically exposed via the Data (REST) API. If this is the case, `anon` and `authenticated` roles will need to be explicitly granted access.

> Note that this is separate from RLS, which controls which _rows_ are visible once a table is accessible, not whether the table is accessible at all.

When a user reports a SQL-created table is unexpectedly inaccessible, check their Data API settings and whether the roles have been granted access via explicit `GRANT` SQL. When granting public (`anon`/`authenticated`) access, always enable RLS too. See [Exposing a Table to the Data API](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/securing-your-api.md) for the full setup workflow.

**5. RLS in exposed schemas.**
Enable RLS on every table in any exposed schema, which includes `public` by default. This is critical in Supabase because tables in exposed schemas can be reachable through the Data API when the `anon`/`authenticated` roles have access (see [Exposing a Table to the Data API](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/securing-your-api.md)). For private schemas, prefer RLS as defense in depth. After enabling RLS, create policies that match the actual access model rather than defaulting every table to the same `auth.uid()` pattern.

**6. Security checklist.**
When working on any Supabase task that touches auth, RLS, views, storage, or user data, run through this checklist. These are Supabase-specific security traps that silently create vulnerabilities:

- **Auth and session security**
  - **Never use `user_metadata` claims in JWT-based authorization decisions.** In Supabase, `raw_user_meta_data` is user-editable and can appear in `auth.jwt()`, so it is unsafe for RLS policies or any other authorization logic. Store authorization data in `raw_app_meta_data` / `app_metadata` instead.
  - **Deleting a user does not invalidate existing access tokens.** Sign out or revoke sessions first, keep JWT expiry short for sensitive apps, and for strict guarantees validate `session_id` against `auth.sessions` on sensitive operations.
  - **If you use `app_metadata` or `auth.jwt()` for authorization, remember JWT claims are not always fresh until the user's token is refreshed.**

- **API key and client exposure**
  - **Never expose the `service_role` or secret key in public clients.** Prefer publishable keys for frontend code. Legacy `anon` keys are only for compatibility. In Next.js, any `NEXT_PUBLIC_` env var is sent to the browser.

- **RLS, views, and privileged database code**
  - **Views bypass RLS by default.** In Postgres 15 and above, use `CREATE VIEW ... WITH (security_invoker = true)`. In older versions of Postgres, protect your views by revoking access from the `anon` and `authenticated` roles, or by putting them in an unexposed schema.
  - **UPDATE requires a SELECT policy.** In Postgres RLS, an UPDATE needs to first SELECT the row. Without a SELECT policy, updates silently return 0 rows — no error, just no change.
  - **`auth.role()` is deprecated — use the `TO` clause instead.** Supabase has deprecated `auth.role()` in favour of specifying the target role directly on the policy with `TO authenticated` or `TO anon`. Beyond deprecation, `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` breaks silently when anonymous sign-ins are enabled, because anonymous users carry the `authenticated` Postgres role and pass the check regardless of whether the user is genuinely signed in.
    ```sql
    -- Deprecated (do not use)
    create policy "example" on table_name for select
    using ( auth.role() = 'authenticated' );
    ```
  - **`TO authenticated` alone is authentication without authorization (BOLA / IDOR).** Using `TO authenticated` only checks the role — it does not restrict which rows a user can access. The correct pattern combines `TO authenticated` with an ownership predicate in `USING`:
    ```sql
    create policy "example" on table_name for select
    to authenticated
    using ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id );
    ```
  - **Check both existing and proposed rows for UPDATE.** Explicit `USING` and `WITH CHECK` make intent clear. If `WITH CHECK` is omitted, Postgres reuses `USING` for UPDATE/ALL; omission alone is not a bypass. See [CREATE POLICY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpolicy.html). For a generic ownership policy:
    ```sql
    create policy "example" on table_name for update
    to authenticated
    using ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id )
    with check ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id );
    ```
  - **Privileged functions require an explicit access model.** `SECURITY DEFINER` runs with the function owner's privileges; RLS bypass depends on that role and table settings. Prefer `SECURITY INVOKER`. For a documented privileged bootstrap lookup, constrain inputs, returned fields, search path and grants; verify the appropriate actor or service identity, not an assumed `auth.uid()` in every path. Inspect effective schema/function privileges, including default PUBLIC execution rights, and test unauthorized calls under the restricted role.

- **Storage access control**
  - **Storage upsert requires INSERT + SELECT + UPDATE.** Granting only INSERT allows new uploads but file replacement (upsert) silently fails. You need all three.

- **Dependency and supply-chain security**
  - **Always pin package versions and commit lockfiles** when installing Supabase packages (`supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`, `supabase-py`, etc.). See the [npm security guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/security/npm-security.md) for the full checklist.

## Supabase CLI

Always discover commands via `--help` — never guess. The CLI structure changes between versions.

```bash
supabase --help                    # All top-level commands
supabase <group> --help            # Subcommands (e.g., supabase db --help)
supabase <group> <command> --help  # Flags for a specific command
```

**Supabase CLI Known gotchas:**

- `supabase db query` requires **CLI v2.79.0+** → use MCP `execute_sql` or `psql` as fallback
- `supabase db advisors` requires **CLI v2.81.3+** → use MCP `get_advisors` as fallback
- Use the project's Drizzle migration tooling; Supabase CLI migration commands do not own this repository's schema history.

**Version check and upgrade:** Run `supabase --version` to check. For CLI changelogs and version-specific features, consult the [CLI documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/introduction) or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases).

## Supabase MCP Server

For setup instructions, server URL, and configuration, see the [MCP setup guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp).

**Troubleshooting connection issues** — follow these steps in order:

1. **Check if the server is reachable:**
   `curl -so /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp`
   A `401` is expected (no token) and means the server is up. Timeout or "connection refused" means it may be down.

2. **Check `.mcp.json` configuration:**
   Inspect the host's actual connector configuration and project scope without printing secrets. A missing `.mcp.json` alone does not prove misconfiguration; change connection settings only when setup or repair is in scope.

3. **Authenticate the MCP server:**
   If the server is reachable and `.mcp.json` is correct but tools aren't visible, the user needs to authenticate. The Supabase MCP server uses OAuth 2.1 — tell the user to trigger the auth flow in their agent, complete it in the browser, and reload the session.

## Supabase Documentation

Before implementing any Supabase feature, find the relevant documentation. Use these methods in priority order:

1. **MCP `search_docs` tool** (preferred — returns relevant snippets directly)
2. **Fetch docs pages as markdown** — any docs page can be fetched by appending `.md` to the URL path.
3. **Web search** for Supabase-specific topics when you don't know which page to look at.

## Making and Committing Schema Changes

1. Inspect the schema and current scripts in `packages/db/package.json` and the
   affected schema history. Edit the Drizzle source, generate a migration with the
   repository's tooling, and review the SQL and generated metadata.
2. Apply to an isolated local/test database using the existing migration runner;
   test affected constraints and RLS under the restricted runtime role, including
   missing context and a second synthetic workspace.
3. Record compatibility, backfill and recovery implications in
   [docs/SCHEMA_HISTORY.md](../../../docs/SCHEMA_HISTORY.md) as relevant. Use
   [database-design](../database-design/SKILL.md) for migration design details.
4. Keep generation, local validation, commit and remote execution distinct. A
   request to edit a schema does not authorize a production mutation or a commit.
